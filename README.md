# 2023 CS429/529 Project 3: Image Classification

> Third project for the CS ML class at UNM (Spring 2023)
> (Full instructions in [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-seedlings-classification-cs429529))

## Prerequisites

This program is written entirely on **Python**. This project uses the `Keras` library from `Tensorflow` for its models. Some other of the libraries it requires include
- ipykernel
- ipython
- jupyter
- jupyter-client
- jupyter-core
- jupyterlab-pygments
- numpy
- cv2
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- tqdm

It is recommended to create an environment with the packages above if running locally. 

The data necessary to run the code can be found in [the Plants Seedlings dataset site](https://vision.eng.au.dk/plant-seedlings-dataset or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/plant-seedlings-classification-cs429529/data). Make sure to download it and place it in the same folder (or update the locations in the notebooks themselves) before running the notebooks.


## Execution

Activate the environment if working in one. The code can be ran directly from the notebooks.
